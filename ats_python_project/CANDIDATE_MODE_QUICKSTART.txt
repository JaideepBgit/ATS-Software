→ "What are my biggest weaknesses?"
→ "Which areas hurt my score the most?"

IMPROVING RESUME POINTS:
→ "How can I rewrite my experience at [Company]?"
→ "Show me before/after for my bullet points"
→ "Take my first work experience and improve it"

ADDING SKILLS:
→ "Which technical skills should I add?"
→ "What keywords am I missing?"
→ "How can I better showcase my Python expertise?"

GETTING TO 90%+:

                    🎯 EXAMPLE CONVERSATION
================================================================================

You: Why did I get 72%?

AI: Your score is 72% mainly because:
    1. Missing cloud experience (AWS/Azure) - job requires it
    2. Experience described generically without metrics
    3. Missing key technologies: Docker, Kubernetes
    4. No leadership/mentoring mentioned
    
    Your strengths are solid Python skills and education,
    but the gaps in cloud and quantified achievements hurt you.

You: How can I rewrite my first work experience?

AI: BEFORE:
    Software Developer at ABC Corp (2021-2023)
    • Developed web applications
    • Worked with team
    • Fixed bugs
    
    AFTER:
    Full-Stack Software Developer at ABC Corp (2021-2023)
    • Architected 5 Python/Django applications serving 50K+ users,
      reducing load time by 40% through Redis caching
    • Led team of 3 developers in Agile sprints, delivering
      features 25% faster than previous quarters
    • Resolved 200+ production bugs and refactored legacy code,
      improving test coverage from 45% to 85%
    
    Why better: Specific tech, quantified impact, shows leadership

You: What 3 changes would boost my score most?

AI: TOP 3 HIGH-IMPACT CHANGES:
    
    1. ADD CLOUD EXPERIENCE (+15% score)
       - If you used AWS/Azure, add specific examples
       - Mention: EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudFormation
       - If no experience, get AWS certification
    
    2. QUANTIFY EVERYTHING (+10% score)
       - Add numbers to every bullet point
       - Users served, performance gains, cost savings
       - Scale: data volume, traffic, team size
    
    3. EMPHASIZE LEADERSHIP (+8% score)
       - Job wants team leadership
       - Reframe collaboration as "Led team of X"
       - Add: mentoring, code reviews, decisions made
    
    Make these changes → expect 88-95% score!

================================================================================
                    ✅ BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================
